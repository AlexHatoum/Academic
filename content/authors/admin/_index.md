With the growing recognition that addiction vulnerability is grounded in biology, I attempt to advance the study of addiciton through biostatical designs. Particuarly, I am interested in unifying methodologies in neuroimaging, informatics, machine learning, and genome-wide assocation studies. I work predominately with the psychiatric genomics consortium substance use disorders working group. I am incredibly fortunate to have enough data (100,000's of subjects measured on millions of features) to put into place innovative biostatistical pipelines to capture patterns of addiction vulnerability.
